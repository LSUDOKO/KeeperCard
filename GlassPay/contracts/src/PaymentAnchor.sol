/// @title PaymentAnchor — the AttestPay source-chain anchor
/// @notice Records that an AttestPay card paid someone, as an event on a chain the
/// Attestcoin attestor network actually watches. `AttestPayASC` on Creditcoin then
/// proves these events cross-chain and turns them into verifiable credit history.
///
/// WHY THIS CONTRACT EXISTS AND WHERE IT LIVES
///
/// AttestPay's USDC payments execute on Base, via ERC-7710 delegations through the
/// 1Shot relayer. The Attestcoin protocol on Creditcoin CC3 testnet attests exactly
/// two source chains — Ethereum mainnet (chainKey 3) and Ethereum Sepolia (chainKey 1)
/// — which you can confirm yourself with `get_supported_chains()` on the ChainInfo
/// precompile. Base is not among them. So a Base transaction cannot be proven into
/// Creditcoin directly, and this contract is deployed on ETHEREUM SEPOLIA instead: it
/// anchors the facts of a Base payment onto an attested chain, and that anchoring
/// transaction is what gets proven.
///
/// WHAT THE RESULTING PROOF DOES AND DOES NOT ESTABLISH
///
/// Be precise about this, because the distinction is the whole trust model:
///
///   PROVEN cryptographically, no oracle trusted: that this `PaymentAnchored` event,
///   with exactly these field values, was included in an attested Sepolia block.
///   `AttestPayASC` decodes the fields from the proven transaction bytes, so nobody
///   — including whoever submits the proof — can alter them in flight.
///
///   NOT proven: that the Base payment described by the anchor actually happened.
///   The AttestPay server writes the anchor, so the Base -> Sepolia hop is the
///   server's attestation, not Attestcoin's. `sourceTxHash` is recorded so any
///   verifier can independently check the Base transaction and hold the anchor
///   to account; `anchoredBy` records who made the claim.
///
/// Anchoring is permissionless on purpose — any address may anchor, and the anchorer
/// is recorded in the event. Consumers decide which anchorers they trust rather than
/// this contract maintaining a privileged writer set. `AttestPayASC` takes the
/// stricter line and only credits anchors from an anchorer it was configured with.
