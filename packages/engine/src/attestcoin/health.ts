// which needs the attestation lag and the local queue side by side. It also answers
// the strategic one: "is Base attested yet?", straight from the live registry.

 *   - verified volume (scale)
 *   - history length  (age: a long record is harder to fake than a large one)
 * Terms compliance, when measurable, scales the result.
 *
 * `CreditPassport.scoreOf` computes the same base on-chain and then applies the credit
 * adjustments (repaid lines up, defaults and upheld disputes down); when the passport
 * contract is configured, prefer its number — this one is the payments-only summary.
 *
 * This is a readable summary of public on-chain facts, not a risk model. Anyone
 * wanting a real one should read the underlying payments from the ASC directly. */
